# Gramine dependencies table

The table is available at https://woju.github.io/gramine-deps-table.

It shows [Gramine's](https://github.com/gramineproject/gramine) external
dependencies and software it otherwise interacts with, as packaged by various
distributions I care about. This is mostly for deciding which versions we can
require.

Most of the config is in [distros.toml](data/distros.toml). Also see comments there.

## HOWTO

```sh
./deploy.sh
firefox _site/index.html
```

<!-- vim: set tw=80 : -->
